<p>Welcome to the XWorkflows Library Documentation!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-xworkflows">What is XWorkflows?</h2>
<p>XWorkflows is a powerful and flexible .NET library designed to simplify the management of workflows on entities. It provides a clean and organized approach to handle state transitions and actions for your entities, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior throughout your application.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-xworkflows">Why Use XWorkflows?</h2>
<p>Managing workflows and state transitions for entities can be a challenging task in software development. As your application grows, maintaining the logic for each state and action becomes increasingly complex and error-prone, leading to spaghetti code and decreased maintainability.</p>
<p>XWorkflows addresses these challenges by offering a structured and modular solution for defining, organizing, and executing workflows on entities. With XWorkflows, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve Code Organization: XWorkflows promotes a well-structured approach to define states, actions, and events for your entities. This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.</li>
<li>Reduce Code Duplication: By centralizing workflow logic in a single place, XWorkflows eliminates the need to duplicate code across different parts of your application.</li>
<li>Enforce Consistent Workflows: XWorkflows ensures that entities follow predefined state transitions and actions, enforcing business rules and maintaining the integrity of your application's data.</li>
<li>Simplify Error Handling: XWorkflows provides meaningful error messages and exceptions to handle scenarios where entities cannot transition to certain states or when actions fail.</li>
<li>Flexibility and Extensibility: The library is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to customize its behavior through extensions or by deriving from the base classes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2>
<p>To make the most of XWorkflows, it's essential to understand some key concepts used within the library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow Entity: Represents an entity whose state transitions are subject to workflow behavior.</li>
<li>Workflow Action: A piece of code executed upon a trigger, such as an HTTP endpoint. It performs tasks within the Execute method, such as storing field values or performing calculations.</li>
<li>Workflow Event: A piece of code executed after an action, handling tasks like logging events or performing post-action execution logic.</li>
<li>Workflow State: Represents a state to which an entity transitions after executing an action.</li>
<li>Workflow: A logical grouping of actions that defines the workflow behavior for an entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-is-this-documentation-for">Who is this Documentation for?</h2>
<p>This documentation is intended for developers working on .NET applications and looking for an efficient way to manage workflows on entities. Whether you are building a small application with a few state transitions or a large enterprise-level project with complex workflows, XWorkflows can streamline your development process and enhance the maintainability of your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-documentation">How to Use this Documentation</h2>
<p>This documentation is organized to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the XWorkflows library. It covers basic usage, advanced scenarios, code examples, and best practices. You can follow the documentation sequentially to get started or use it as a reference guide to specific topics as needed.</p>
<p>Let's dive in and explore the power of XWorkflows to manage your application's workflows effectively!</p>
